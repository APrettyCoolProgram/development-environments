### Synopsis

The Omen is a supernatural horror film.

The film's plot follows Damien Thorn, a young child replaced at birth by his father, unbeknownst to his wife, after their biological child dies shortly after birth.

As a series of mysterious events and violent deaths occur around the family and Damien enters childhood, they come to learn he is in fact the prophesied Antichrist.

### Plot (1976)

American diplomat Robert Thorn and his wife Katherine are living in Rome, where Katherine gives birth to a boy who Robert is told died immediately. Hospital chaplain Father Spiletto persuades Robert to secretly adopt another baby whose mother just died in childbirth. Robert does not tell Katherine the child is not their own. They name him Damien.

Five years later, Robert is Ambassador to the United Kingdom in London when mysterious phenomena begin to plague the Thorns: a menacing Rottweiler appears at their home, Damien's nanny publicly hangs herself during his fifth birthday party, new nanny Mrs. Baylock arrives unexpectedly, Damien violently resists entering a church, and Damien's presence frightens animals at a safari park. Father Brennan warns Robert about Damien's origins, hinting that he is not human and insisting Robert take Holy Communion. He tells Robert that Damien is the son of Satan, that Katherine is pregnant, and that Damien will kill his unborn sibling and parents. Later, Father Brennan is killed by a falling lightning rod. Katherine tells Robert she wants an abortion, which he opposes. Damien knocks Katherine over a railing to the floor below, injuring her and causing her to miscarry.

Photographer Keith Jennings notices shadows in photographs of the nanny and Father Brennan that presaged their deaths. Keith shows Robert the photos along with news clippings and Biblical passages that Father Brennan had suggesting the coming of the Antichrist. He accompanies Robert to Rome to investigate Damien's birth. They learn that a fire destroyed the hospital, including Katherine's maternity records, and killed the staff on duty. They find Father Spiletto in a monastery severely burned, mute, blind in one eye, and partially paralyzed. He directs them to the cemetery where Damien's biological mother is buried. In Damien's mother's grave, Robert and Keith find a jackal carcass and, in the next plot, a child's skeleton with a shattered skull. Robert realizes that the child was his own son, murdered so that Damien could take his place. A pack of Rottweilers drives Robert and Keith from the cemetery.

Robert calls Katherine in the hospital to tell her she must leave London. Before she can do so, Mrs. Baylock throws her to her death from a window. Robert and Keith befriend Antichrist exorcism expert Carl Bugenhagen in Israel who says that if Damien is the true Antichrist, he will bear a birthmark in the shape of three sixes. Carl gives Robert seven daggers with which to kill Damien on hallowed ground. Robert refuses to do so, but Keith remains convinced about the necessity of it. Afterward, Keith is decapitated by a sheet of glass. Robert then reluctantly accepts his task.

Robert finds the birthmark on the sleeping Damien's scalp and is attacked by Mrs. Baylock, whom he stabs to death. Armed with the daggers, Robert drives Damien to a cathedral. His erratic driving draws the attention of the police. Robert drags a screaming Damien onto the altar to kill him and begs God to forgive him, but the police arrive on the scene and shoot him to death before he can do so.

The double funeral of Katherine and Robert is attended by the U.S. President and the First Lady, who have Damien with them. Damien turns and smiles at the camera.

### Plot (2006)

Robert Thorn, an American diplomat stationed in Italy is told that his son was stillborn. Unknown to his unconscious wife, Katherine, Robert adopts an orphaned newborn at the suggestion of the hospital's chaplain Catholic priest, Father Spiletto. Naming him Damien, Robert and Katherine raise the boy. Robert's career ascends over the course of the next five years. He is named Deputy Ambassador to the Court of St. James's in the United Kingdom. Following the death of the previous ambassador in a suspicious vehicle fire caused by a vagrant, Robert assumes his position and settles in a large estate just outside London. However, disturbing events begin to occur, including the suicide of Damien's nanny, who saw a black dog and made eye contact with it, at his birthday party.

Robert is approached by Father Brennan, who claims to have been involved with events surrounding Damien's birth. Meanwhile, photographer Keith Jennings finds that several of his photographs contain mysterious omens, including premonitions of people's deaths. A new nanny, Mrs. Baylock, is hired. Tension rises when Mrs. Baylock starts to make decisions without the consent of the Thorns, including adopting a Rottweiler for Damien's protection.

Following an incident near a chapel in which Damien attacks Katherine, she begins experiencing vivid dreams about her son, one of these involving a red-hooded jackal skeleton. When the Thorns visit a zoo, the animals react violently at the sight of Damien. Katherine begins to wonder if there is something wrong with Damien. Father Brennan confronts Robert, telling him that Damien's mother was a jackal and that the boy is the Antichrist. He explains that Damien must die and a man named Bugenhagen who is located in Megiddo can assist. After being rebuked, Father Brennan is killed during a lightning storm.

Katherine discovers she is pregnant and is determined to get an abortion, in fear of having a child similar to Damien. Soon afterward, Damien causes an accident in which Katherine is severely injured resulting in her miscarriage. While recovering in the hospital, Katherine confides in Robert her suspicions that Damien is evil. Robert decides to rendezvous with Jennings and search for Damien's biological mother. The pair discover the hospital where Damien was delivered has since been demolished after a fire. They travel to Subiaco and meet Father Spiletto, who directs them to a graveyard. There they find the grave of Damien's mother, who is revealed to indeed have been a jackal. In the neighboring tomb, Robert discovers the corpse of his murdered biological son. He and Jennings are attacked by a pack of dogs and barely escape.

Mrs. Baylock visits Katherine in the hospital and causes her to have an air embolism which kills her. Learning of Katherine's death, Robert goes to Megiddo, meets Bugenhagen and receives instructions on how to kill Damien on consecrated ground with seven sacrificial daggers. Bugenhagen tells Robert to examine Damien for a birthmark in the shape of three sixes ("666"). However, Robert refuses to kill his son and throws the daggers on the ground. While reaching down to pick up the daggers, Jennings is suddenly decapitated by a falling sign.

Robert takes the daggers, arrives home and is attacked by Mrs. Baylock's Rottweiler, which he traps in the basement. In Damien's room, he finds the 666 birthmark. Mrs. Baylock attacks Robert. He fends her off, takes Damien, and drives to a nearby cathedral, running over Mrs. Baylock in the process. Pursued by the police, Robert flees to a church to kill Damien but is shot dead before he can by a Diplomatic Protection officer.

As the Pope simultaneously dies, Robert's funeral is attended by the President of the United States who holds Damien's hand. Damien then looks at the audience and smiles knowingly as the credits roll.

### Analysis

American scholar Brad Duren argued that The Omen was part of a trend of films featuring cosmic horror that started with Rosemary's Baby in 1968, but the film was unusual at the time because it concerned the "end times" predicted in The Book of Revelation and focused on a form of premillennialism favored by American dispensationalists. Duren further maintained that the box office success of The Omen, which concerned the first stages of the Apocalypse as the Antichrist is born, reflected the zeitgeist of 1970s America.[24]

In 1973, an advertising executive and evangelical Christian, Robert Munger, who had read Hal Lindsey's book The Late, Great Planet Earth, speculated to film producer Harvey Bernard about the possibility that the Antichrist might be walking the earth in the form of a child, unknown to the vast majority of humanity. This conversation inspired Bernard with the idea for the film that became The Omen. Bernard commissioned scriptwriter David Seltzer to write a script for the film. Seltzer in turn borrowed many ideas from dispensationalism, especially The Late, Great Planet Earth, while also inventing his own.[7] For an example, a supposed quote from the Book of Revelation featured in The Omen ("When the Jews return to Zion and a comet rips the sky and the Holy Roman Empire rises, then you and I must die; from the eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore, turning man against his brother, 'til man exists no more") is not in fact in that book. Likewise, the sinister figure who will rule the world for seven years predicted in Revelation, commonly known as the Antichrist, is not described in the Bible as the son of Satan, whereas Satan is the father of the Antichrist in The Omen.

Jim Knipfel in The Omen: The Pedigree of a Horror Classic on Den of Geek, opines of The Omen, "[T]here is no single source quite as central and clearly influential as "The Devil's Platform", a 1974 episode from the first season of Kolchak: The Night Stalker, with stars Tom Skerritt (credited as "Tom Skerrit") as Robert Palmer, a young politician whose meteoric rise seemed to come out of nowhere. He seems a shoo-in to become the new state senator from Illinois, but is already gunning for the White House. ...Palmer is rising quickly in the world of politics, which of course was the subtext of the entire Omen franchise. Anyone who threatens his rise or stands in his way — major political donors, speechwriters for the opposing candidate, even the opposing candidate himself — ends up dying mysteriously as the result of a tragic and freakish accident, which was the hook that brought most people to the theaters to see the Omen films in the first place. ...Palmer, again like Damien, also has a very protective Rottweiler familiar, who is impervious to harm. ... Like David Warner's photographer in the first film, inexplicable photographic anomalies help point Kolchak in the right direction. ... And finally, in the end the ambitious Satanic candidate is dispatched with a holy instrument (blessed daggers in The Final Conflict, holy water in The Night Stalker). So there. In a way, watching "The Devil's Platform" is a bit like watching all three Omen films from an outsider journalist's perspective, except Kolchak is able to wrap the whole thing up neatly in an hour."[25]

The success of the film in 1976 may have been due to a sense of malaise in the West at the time. As film critic John Kenneth Muir wrote: "What if the Bible is correct? What if all the signs of the Apocalypse are happening around about now? Would we believe them? Heck, would we even notice?" Duren wrote that, although it was unlikely that most people who viewed the film in 1976 accepted the dispensationalist viewpoint, the mere feeling that the world or the West was in terminal decline gave the film a resonance that its subsequent sequels lacked. Beyond the success of the film, Duren wrote that the impact of the film on popular culture can be seen in the way that many people accept the dispensationalist reading of the Book of Revelation as the correct interpretation whereas in fact, the dispensationalist interpretation was and still is rejected by many churches. Duren wrote that dispensationalism had once been a "fringe" theory within Protestant theology, but due to the popularity of The Omen it is now widely accepted as doctrine.[26]

Duren notes that in the film it has to be explained to Robert Thorn that the number 666 is the "mark of the beast" and speculates that audiences in 1976 were not familiar with this aspect of the Book of Revelation, but because of the film's popularity, the number 666 has entered popular culture and most people, even those of a secular bent, are aware of the sinister significance attached to the number.[27]

### Music

An original score for the film, including the movie's theme song "Ave Satani", was composed by Jerry Goldsmith, for which he received the only Oscar of his career. The score features a strong choral segment, with a foreboding Latin chant. According to Goldsmith's wife, Carol, the composer initially struggled with ideas for the score until one evening when he suddenly, happily announced to her, "I hear voices", referring to an orchestral chorus or choir. The Latin of this song contains some errors: "We drink the blood" must be Sanguinem bibimus (accusative form of sanguis),[29] also "Hail Satan!" is Ave Satana (vocative form),[30] and as for Ave Versus Christus is nonsense in Latin: the correct form is Ave Antichriste (vocative form of Antichristus,[31] the Latin name for the Biblical Antichrist).

## Seven Sacred Daggers of Tel Megiddo

The Seven Sacred Daggers of Tel Megiddo are a set of seven sacred knives and the only weapons that can kill the Antichrist.

### History
The Daggers are designed to kill the Antichrist, and were made in Megiddo, where Christianity began. It is implied in the novelization of The Omen that the Daggers were created by an ancestor of Carl Bugenhagen circa 1024 AD, as a means of destroying Satan's progeny.

### Usage
The Daggers of Megiddo are designed to kill the Antichrist. One of the Daggers extinguishes the Antichrist's physical life force, while the other six extinguish his spiritual life. In order to destroy the Antichrist forever, the Daggers must be stabbed in his chest in a sequence that forms the cross; the Dagger that extinguishes physical life must serve as the centre of the cross that the Daggers form.

The ritual must also be carried out in a church, and the Antichrist must die on the church's altar. However, if the ritual is not carried out this specific way, then while the Antichrist's body may die, his soul will survive and live on.

### The Omen
The Seven Daggers were excavated in Tel Megiddo by Carl Bugenhagen. When Robert Thorn and Keith Jennings come to him looking for a way to kill the Antichist, Bugenhagen gives them the Daggers of Megiddo and explains how to use them to kill the Antichrist. Afterwards, Robert refuses to kill Damien as he has raised him as his own son, and throws the Daggers away. When Jennings goes to retrieve the Daggers, he is decapitated in a freak accident. Robert then decides to kill Damien after all, and takes the Daggers back to London with him.

In London, when Robert discovers that Damien is indeed the Antichrist, he kidnaps him and takes him to a church. On the church's altar, Robert prepares to kill Damien with the Daggers, but at the last second before Robert can stab Damien, police arrive and shoot and kill Robert.

According to the novelization of the original version of the film, after Robert was killed, the priest of the church where Robert tried to stab Damien had the Daggers of Megiddo sent back to Bugenhagen in Israel.

### Damien - Omen II
A week after Robert Thorn's death, Bugenhagen gives his old friend Michael Morgan a box containing the Seven Daggers of Megiddo and a note explaining that Damien Thorn is the Antichrist. When Bugenhagen takes Morgan to Yigael's Wall in the ruins of (what appears to be) Megiddo, the ceiling collapses and the two are buried alive with the box containing the Daggers of Megiddo.

The Daggers remain buried inside the box for seven years, until the box is unearthed and sent to the Thorn Museum in Chicago. When Dr. Charles Warren opens the box, he discovers the Daggers of Megiddo inside along with the note explaining that Damien is the Antichrist. He leaves the Daggers in a drawer in his office at the museum, and goes to Richard with the note.

Some days later, when Richard searches Warren's office for the Daggers of Megiddo, Ann finds the Daggers in the drawer and stabs Richard with them.

Damien then blows up the Thorn Museum's boiler, killing Ann and destroying the museum.

### The Final Conflict
After the Thorn Museum was burnt down by the fire Damien caused, the Seven Daggers of Megiddo remained buried in the ruins for twenty years, until they are found in the rubble by a construction worker during a reconstruction attempt. The worker sells the Daggers at a pawnshop, where they are bought and put up for auction. When the auctioneer who buys them researches the Daggers and realizes what they are, he hands them over to a priest, who in turn sends them to Father De Carlo in Subiaco.

De Carlo divides each of the Seven Daggers among himself and his six priests, and they then travel to London to hunt down and kill Damien Thorn with the Daggers. At an interview between Damien and Kate Reynolds, Brother Benito tries to stab Damien with his Dagger of Megiddo. However, he is killed when he falls and is caught in plastic that catches fire. Damien then takes his Dagger.

Some days later, Brother Matteus lures Damien across the countryside of England to an old ruin, where Brothers Paulo and Martin plan to ambush him with their Daggers. However, Damien causes Martin and Paulo to hallucinate Matteus as him, causing the two to stab him instead. Damien then leaves Paulo and Martin trapped under a grate to die, and takes their three Daggers of Megiddo.

One day, Brothers Simeon and Antonio lure Damien onto a bridge while he is participating in a fox hunt, but Damien easily kills them and takes their two Daggers. Some days later, when Kate reluctantly takes Damien and Peter to an old ruin to find Christ, De Carlo ambushes and tries to stab Damien with his Dagger of Megiddo, but Damien uses Peter as a human shield against the dagger.

Enraged at her son's death, Kate pursues Damien through the ruin with De Carlo's Dagger, and attacks and stabs him with it, fatally wounding him.

# Locations

## Tel Megiddo

Tel Megiddo, better known as just Megiddo, is a tel in Israel near Kibbutz Megiddo, about 30km south-east of Haifa. It is known for its historical, geographical, and theological importance, especially under its Greek name Armageddon.

In ancient times Megiddo was an important city-state. Excavations have unearthed twenty-six layers of ruins, indicating a long period of settlement. Megiddo is strategically located at the head of a pass through the Carmel Ridge overlooking the Jezreel Valley from the west.

Carl Bugenhagen mentioned in The Omen (1976) that Megiddo was where Christianity originally began. It also appeared in Damien - Omen II that when Yigael went insane and painted images of Damien Thorn, the future Antichrist, onto the wall of an underground chamber, that chamber was in Megiddo.

### The Omen
Robert Thorn and Keith Jennings travel to Tel Megiddo searching for a way to kill Damien. There, Bugenhagen gives them the seven Daggers of Megiddo and gives them instructions on how to use them.

### Damien - Omen II
A week after Yigael's Wall is excavated in what appears to be Megiddo, Bugenhagen takes Michael Morgan down into the ruins, and shows him the Wall to convince him that Damien Thorn is indeed the Antichrist. The ruins then collapse, burying Michael and Bugenhagen alive along with Yigael's Wall.

Seven years later, Thorn Industries excavated Bugenhagen's skeleton, two pieces of Yigael's Wall, and an ancient statue of the Whore of Babylon from the ruin.

# Concepts

# Armageddon

Armageddon is, according to the Holy Bible, the final battle between good and evil in which the world will experience a vivid depiction of spiritual warfare as the armies of Satan and the Antichrist wage an all-out war against the armies of God.

However, the exact nature of Armageddon is hotly debated, with many believing it be more symbolic than literal while others hold true to the ancient prophecy - regardless of the details, Armageddon is believed by many to be the defining moment that will lead to the Day of Judgement, in which all evil is ultimately cast from the world by God Himself to make way for the new world.

According to one premillennial Christian interpretation, the Messiah will return to Earth and defeat the Antichrist and the Devil in the Battle of Armageddon.

The Omen
The name of Tel Megiddo is a bastardization of "Armageddon", though Keith Jennings incorrectly states that Megiddo's name is derived from the term Armageddon.

### The Omen
The name of Tel Megiddo is a bastardization of "Armageddon", though Keith Jennings incorrectly states that Megiddo's name is derived from the term Armageddon.

### Damien - Omen II
According to the Book of Revelation, during Armageddon, seven kings of ten nations will form an alliance with Satan and will be granted temporary power by Satan in return. The kings will eventually come to hate the Whore of Babylon; they will make her desolate and naked, and will burn her with fire and eat her flesh. Dr. Charles Warren states that the Whore of Babylon represents Rome. The Book of Revelation also predicts that the Antichrist will cause much death and suffering during his reign over Earth.

### The Final Conflict
It is indicated that, unbeknownst to most of mankind, Armageddon is happening in the form of the worldwide economic crisis during Damien Thorn's time as head of Thorn Industries. As predicted in the Bible, after Damien spends seven years as head of Thorn Industries, Christ returns to Earth on the morning of March 24 to liberate it from the Antichrist; and when Damien dies a week later, Christ restores peace to the Earth.

### Omen IV: The Awakening
It is stated in the Book of Revelation that there will be a fourth kindom (thought to be Rome), from which the Antichrist will come from. It is also indicated in Revelation that the Antichrist will have 'authority' for forty-two months.
